            Saint Anselm College is a small liberal arts school located just outside Manchester, New Hampshire, and it has grown from its Benedictine roots into a close and welcoming academic community. The college was founded in 1889 by monks who wanted to create a place where education and personal growth were equally important. Their influence can still be felt in the way the campus operates today. When you walk around the grounds, you notice the peaceful atmosphere right away. The stone buildings, open green spaces, and views of the surrounding hills give the college a classic New England feel. This setting makes it easy for students to settle in and feel at home, since the campus is large enough to explore but small enough to feel familiar. Even though it is close to the city of Manchester, the campus still has a quiet environment that helps students stay focused on their classes and feel more connected to the people around them.
            A big part of life at Saint Anselm is the strong sense of community that forms both inside and outside the classroom. Students often describe the campus as a place where people look out for each other, and where it is easy to get involved in clubs, service work, athletics, and campus traditions. The college also stands out for how connected it is to national politics through its New Hampshire Institute of Politics. Because the state hosts the first presidential primary, many political candidates, journalists, and public speakers visit the college during election seasons. Students can attend events, listen to debates, volunteer for campaigns, or simply observe the excitement of national politics up close. These experiences add something unique to campus life that many other small colleges cannot offer. When combined with strong academics, steady support from faculty, and a campus culture built on respect and community values, Saint Anselm College creates an environment where students can learn, grow, and feel like they truly belong.

            The student body at Saint Anselm stays just above two thousand undergraduates, which helps keep class sizes small and encourages a lot of interaction between students and professors. Many students appreciate this because it creates an environment where they can ask questions, get feedback, and build real relationships with their instructors. The college offers more than ninety different majors and programs, so there is room for exploration even though it is not a large university. Students interested in the liberal arts can take a variety of core classes that strengthen writing, communication, and critical thinking, while those looking for more career-focused paths can choose programs like nursing, business, criminal justice, education, and other fields that prepare them for specific professions. The college has continued to invest in academic resources, including a modern nursing and health sciences facility that adds new labs, simulation spaces, and opportunities for hands-on learning. These updates show that the school is trying to grow its academic offerings without losing the personal feel that makes it unique.
